# Detecting-attacks-and-anomalies-in-BoT-IoT

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting security threats in IoT devices using machine learning. The system is designed to analyze network traffic, identify potential security risks, and classify threats based on historical data. It leverages Python, machine learning libraries, and IoT datasets to enhance cybersecurity measures.

## Features
- **Threat Detection**: Identifies and classifies security threats in IoT environments.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes ML models for anomaly detection and classification.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Processes network packets to detect malicious activities.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides insights through data visualization and reporting.
